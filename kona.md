## 🌺 Romance Tips

- **Slow down** — this is Hawaii. Island time is real. Don't rush.
- **Go phone-free at meals** — be present with each other
- **Watch every sunset** — they're all different, all beautiful
- **Say yes to spontaneous detours** — best memories are unplanned
- **Sleep in if you want** — this is vacation, not boot camp
- **Get champagne for the room** — have a drink on the lanai one evening
- **Take photos of each other** — not just selfies
- **Dance at the lū'au** — be goofy, have fun
- **Swim at night** — resort pool under the stars is magical

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Reef-safe sunscreen only** — Hawaii law, protects coral
- **Respect sea turtles** — 10 ft distance, never touch
- **Drive carefully** — roads can be narrow, winding, dark at night
- **Stay hydrated** — tropical sun + altitude + activities = drink water
- **Check weather** — Big Island has microclimates, pack layers
- **Be flexible** — if something doesn't work, pivot. It's an adventure.

**This trip is about two things: celebrating five years together, and starting the rest of your lives. Make it count.** 💕
